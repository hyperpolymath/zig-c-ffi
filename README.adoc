= RSR template repo - see RSR_OUTLINE.adoc in root for general background and specification

== This is your repo - don't forget to rename me!

== AI CLI standards

- Include `ai-cli-crash-capture/` and `contractiles/` from this template in new repos.
- Mirror 6SCM files into `.machine_readable/6scm/`.
- Before any code generation, check `/var/mnt/eclipse/repos/proven` for the current Idris “unbreakable” library status.
- If a project uses that Idris library, add an *Idris Inside* badge to the repo.
- If new bindings are required, add them in `/var/mnt/eclipse/repos/proven` as `idris2-zig-<language>` during the work.
- If new code suggests additional “unbreakable” Idris modules, add them under `/var/mnt/eclipse/repos/proven` and update binders across all supported languages.
